Years ago, I had no clue that my life would take such a drastic turn. Back then, I was an ambitious lawyer, focused on winning every case. My clients were often unsavory characters, some even dangerous, whose names were whispered in circles I wasn't always proud to be associated with. But I thrived in the chaos, quickly realizing that law wasn't just about justice. It was a game of strategy. My ability to navigate this shady terrain earned me both wealth and notoriety. The deeper I went, the more entangled I became, forming alliances with those who could shift things in my favor. As time passed, my moral compass shifted, leading me to make decisions that left me indebted to men like Sergeant Devin Cross. Despite his upstanding nature, our paths crossed during the worst time in his life. That encounter would later come back to haunt him, linking us in an unspoken contract. He owed me after I saved his family's home from foreclosure, and it wasn't long before I called in that favor. What neither of us could anticipate was how this debt would bring unwanted attention to both of us. Falcon's Nest, a bar and grill along the aging Route 7, sits at the intersection of three counties just outside town. Known as a hangout for local law enforcement it might not seem like an ideal spot for a discreet meeting, which is why it was perfect for me. I pulled into the parking lot, already crowded, and headed inside. For a cop bar, Falcon's Nest was surprisingly upscale, with a spacious bar and plenty of seating. It was the last Friday of the month, busy but not overwhelming, ideal for a conversation with Sergeant Cross. The crowd made the meeting appear casual, not suspicious. When I walked in, most of the patrons greeted me with hostile stares. I expected it given that I was suspected of liquidating my unfaithful wife and her lover, a police detective. Of course there was no charge, no bodies, no evidence. The couple and their car had vanished without a trace. Still, in their eyes, I was guilty. I had motive and as a lowly lawyer I needed proof. When Devin arrived, he didn't look thrilled with my choice of venue. He was tall, well-built and could only be described as honorable. He was there to repay a debt and cleanse himself of the guilt of owing a man like me. Now let me be frank. I'm what you'd call crooked, a lawyer without any moral standing. I've been an unindicted co-conspirator in at least half a dozen organized crime cases. Poor Devin was in a bad place the day he walked into my office with a thick stack of foreclosure papers. At the time, he was a Metropolitan Police Officer, a sufferer of carnivory mortgage fraud. He was early 2008 and he, his wife and their four children were about to lose their home. He had already approached every honest and semi-honest lawyer, but had found no real help. He came to me out of sheer desperation. Frankly, I'm not sure why I helped him. He was a good, honest cop, loyal to his friends, but he wasn't someone I could use and he couldn't pay. He admitted that right away. Online scammers had taken his last dime.
