Language is not just a tool. It is an expression of our culture, our identity, and our emotions. It allows us to share our deepest thoughts and feelings, connect with others, and understand ourselves. This connection between language and humanity should not be lost. Even as machines become increasingly adept at understanding our language, the way we use it remains something unique.
